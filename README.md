# FirstCompiler
> **NOTE:** this is my first compiler I am making, and also didn't think of a name ðŸ˜…. So ya it will be called FirstCompiler.

### TODO:
1. **LEXER:** Making a Lexer which converts source code to tokens.
2. **PARSE:** Making a Parser which converts it to AST (Abstract Syntax Tree).
    > **NOTE:** ATS - A tree containg the data about the program.
3. **MAIN COMPILER:** Compiler which compiles AST to Assembly.
